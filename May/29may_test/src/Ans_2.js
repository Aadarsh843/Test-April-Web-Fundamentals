//Question 2. What is the difference between null , undefined and not defined.

//null:-

let d  = null;
console.log(d);    //The code suggests that the variable is empty at the moment and may have a value later
                   //Null is a reserved keyword in javascript.
                   


//undefined:- 

let j;
console.log(j); //If a variable is declared but the value is not assigned, then the value of that variable will be undefined.
                // Un-defined: when no value is Assigned to a variable, the value is called "un-defined".


//not defined:- 

console.log(k);   //Not-defined: when the variable is not present in your code, the value is called "not-defined".
